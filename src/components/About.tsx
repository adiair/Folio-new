          Hi, I’m a Full-Stack Developer focused on building scalable
          and efficient web applications. I specialize in Next.js, React,
          Express.js, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB, with expertise in cloud services
          like Azure for optimized deployment.

          I’m comfortable working across the stack and love exploring new technologies 
          that make development faster and smarter.

          I thrive in building meaningful, real-world projects from solo 
          prototypes to team-based solutions. I love exploring new technologies 
          that make development faster and smarter.
